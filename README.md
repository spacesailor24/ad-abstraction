ERC-4337 gas sponsoring utilizing advertisements and/or quizzes to earn gas credits

## Architecture

Currently still in experimental phase, but a high-level idea is allow gas sponsors to provide videos and/or documentation that can be parsed via ChatGPT, or similar, to generate a questionnaire provided to the sponsoree to earn gas credits which can be redeemed when sending transactions via ERC-4337
