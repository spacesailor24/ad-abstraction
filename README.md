ERC-4337 gas sponsoring utilizing advertisements and/or quizzes to earn gas credits

## Architecture

Currently still in experimental phase, but a high-level idea is to allow gas sponsors to provide videos and/or documentation that can be parsed via ChatGPT, or similar tools, to generate a questionnaire provided to the sponsoree to earn gas credits which can be redeemed when sending transactions via ERC-4337

Ideally, in the future this architecture would includes wallet extensions, such as MetaMask Snaps, to aid in the use of ERC-4337 gas sponsoring via the previously mentioned gas credits
